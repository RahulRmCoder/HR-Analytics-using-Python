## Key Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Preprocessing the HR dataset for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing data to identify patterns and trends related to attrition.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Using metrics to pinpoint factors influencing employee churn.
- **Visualizations**: Creating meaningful graphs to summarize insights, such as attrition by department and salary levels.

## Tools and Libraries

- **Python**: Core programming language for analysis.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: Plotting and data visualization.
- **Seaborn**: Advanced statistical visualizations.
